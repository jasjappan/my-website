Fiction: Robby the Robot
I won't lie -- there are several moments throughout the week when I think to myself, "I could really go for a donut right now." It conjures images of the 1956 film Forbidden Planet, in which the Robby the Robot character prepares a meal of donuts for a group of space travelers. How convenient.
reality: robochef
n the movie, the robot is able to do that after being "fed" a sample of the food, which is analyzed in an internal lab and can then reproduce. And while today's real-life cooking chef doesn't exactly emulate that science, it comes close. The robochef depicted in the video below memorizes human actions by recording the movements of an actual chef via three-dimensional camera, and translates them "into highly precise movements," according to IFLScience.

This film is named for its hero and main character: A tiny robot named WALL-E. Left all alone on Earth after all humans have abandoned the planet, this artificially intelligent being spends his days essentially cleaning up after what was left behind on the planet, which explains why his name stands for “Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class.” He can see, he can sigh, and he can even befriend a cockroach, which -- quite fittingly -- he names Hal.
reality: cosmo
In the summer of 2016, it was announced that the Anki company would release Cozmo: “A real-life robot like you’ve only seen in movies,” the product description reads, “with a one-of-a-kind personality that evolves the more you hang out.” Like WALL-E, Cozmo goes through the process of waking up and starting its day, and even shows signs of emotion -- like when it gets knocked on its side and begins to emulate frustrated behavior. But don’t feel bad. It also exhibits signs of happiness while playing games.

TARS, the main robot featured in Interstellar, looks nothing like a human. It also looks nothing like most robots in existence today. Sci-fi movies typically imagine robots that, like the iconic C-3PO, look roughly human-like  .TARS, in contrast, doesnot really have legs or arms or any other recognizable telltales of a biological organism. It reflects a different approach to the development of robots, more common among real-life
 roboticists than those apparently working in most science fiction universes, that puts function above humanness in the design of technology. TARS is a  last-minute rescue of Dr. Brand. It speaks in fluent  English and makes valuable contributions to the mission on a regular basis.
 In this regard, TARS is a model for a system that is user-friendly (combining fluid natural dialogue with common sense) while
not seeking to re-create the physical and cognitive limitations of humans.  In order for it to do an adequate job of assisting humans, TARS needs certain humanlike functionalities, such as the ability to speak and understand language, but it neednot be precisely made in mans own image, either.
